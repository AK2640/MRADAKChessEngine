# MRADAKChessEngine
Source code for the MRADAK chess engine written for the ICS3U Culminating.

# Components

The Chess Engine has Three Files: The Engine, the Conversion, and the GUI.

Engine: The Engine uses the StockFish API, and was written by Aarav Kohli.

Conversion: The Conversion uses pure Python, and was written by Aaron Dam.

GUI: The GUI was Written using Tkinter and Python, and was Written by Mitchell Riegert and Aarav Kohli.
     The original version of the engine was written in C#, and the GUI was entirely programmed by Mitchell.
     Aarav only worked on the Python version, due to time constraints.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

To run the code in the program, please download the AVX2 Version of StockFish from https://stockfishchess.org/download/
Extract the ZIP Folder, and place the: stockfish-windows-x86-64-avx2.exe file in the same directory as the entire project,
but most importantly engine.py

Alternatively, the file directory in engine.py can be changed to access the file on the windows operating system.

# Installation

To ensure all libraries are working properly, please run the following command in the cloned repository (Windows).

      pip install stockfish

  Note: Tkinter comes preinstalled in python. To check Python's version, run the following command:

       python --version
